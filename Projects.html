				<h3>AEOLIAN SALTATION CLOUD</h3>
				<p>At the ASU wind tunnel, I conducted a series of experiments using high-speed cameras, high-powered
					laser, and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) to quantify sand particle trajectories and
					characteristics of near-surface sand transport in saltation over various speeds and both flat and
					rippled beds. PTV was successful in detecting sand grain trajectories under different wind speeds
					and bed surface conditions. With increasing wind speed, resultant transport, and ripple development,
					we find important changes in the particle velocity distributions, modes of transport, and
					particle-bed interactions. These results help us address the discrepancies between predicted and
					observed transport rates.

				<h3>NAVAL RESEARCH LAB</h3>
				<p>As a physical scientist with the Naval Research Lab, I've had the privilege to contribute to multiple
					research projects exploring inner-self and coastal sediment transport. Including the Aeolian
					Transport and Turbulence Experiment (ATTEX) at Wallops Island and the Multiphase Transport
					Experiment (MPTEX) off-shore of Ocean City, MD.

				<h3>INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FLUVIAL AND AEOLIAN PROCESSES</h3>
				<p>In April 2022, I was honored to be a volunteer researcher with the Grand Canyon Monitoring and
					Research Center and U.S. Geological Survey studying the Colorado River Dunes. In 2024, I’ll be
					continuing this work as a Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow. This work aims to develop novel model
					workflows to predict the aeolian transport of sand or dust from subaerially exposed river-sourced
					sediment as a function of the use and regulation of Colorado River water supply.

				<h3>EXPLORING PIEDMONT INCISION USING GEOMORPHIC GIS ANALYSIS & NUMERICAL MODELING </h3>
				<p>In northeastern sonoran desert, ephemeral channels incise into the piedmonts This tectonically
					quiescent region experienced slow aggradation as the closed basins filled throughout the Pliocene.
					Then a wave aggradation also occurred with river integration during Quaternary. With the ongoing
					aggradation the expectation would be to see channel infilling on pediments and alluvial fans
					entering these basins. However, various piedmonts in the area, including the Sierra Estrella range,
					show varying degrees of incision. This paper explores a new hypotheses to explain piedmont incision
					despite rising base levels. We hypothesized that a massive lateral shift in base level to the toes
					desert piedmonts could be a potential explanation for the channel incision. Our methods include 1)
					morphometric analyses of the Sierra Estrella bajadas and 2) thought exercise of modeling a pediment
					longitudinal profile as a 1D diffusive system,

				<h3>LINKING PARTICLE TRAJECTORIES TO CHANGES IN BEDFORM 3-DIMENSIONALITY</h3>
				<p>The emergence and organization of subaqueous bedforms in sandy rivers play a significant
					role in sediment flux, flood stage control, and stratigraphic record construction. Previous work is
					largely limited to a 2D streamwise framework; however, natural fluvial dunes display significant
					3-dimensionality. This ongoing work evaluates grain-scale transport, bedform evolution, and fluid
					characteristics to assess the relative importance of lateral and longitudinal fluxes on the
					migration and deformation of sandy bedforms under various transport conditions.

				<p>
					Our dataset, called FloodPlanet, will include 25 major flood events, labeled with co-located Planet,
					Maxar,
					HLS (Harmonized Sentinel-2 and Landsat), and Sentinel-1 data to promote cross-sensor fusion across

					and deep learning modeling efforts in the remote sensing and computer vision fields. We will develop
					our own deep learning models for
					high resolution urban flood detection, and release the the high quality benchmark dataset we will

				<p>
					In this research, we are developing novel sensor fusion techniques to take advantage of the
					expanding availability of sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions to monitor urban
					flooding. To do so, we combine public optical (MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1),
					passive microwave (AMSR, SMAP) imagery and commercial data from PlanetScope with the eventual goal
					of generating 30-meter per-pixel probabilities of inundation in urban areas globally every 3 days.

					widths over time.

					Understanding flood risk in human altered landscapes from cities to farms: inferences from
					satellites and machine learning,
					with initial funding from the Columbia University ActToday Program.
				</h5>
				<p>
					This project leverages inundation observations to understand extreme flood risk in human-modified
					landscapes, specifically in urban and agricultural areas in Bangladesh.
					We will use commercial and public sensors to i) map maximum inundated area for extreme flood events,
					ii) quantify flood risk at watershed scales, and iii) estimate of flood return periods at household
					scales (30m resolution). \
					These objectives will be reached by using deep learning approaches to map floods and damage, and
					estiamte return periods with Bayesian Hierarchical Models.
					We will use optical and radar satellites, including MODIS, Sentinel-1, Planetscope, and the HLS
					(Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 dataset),
					comparing satellite-based flood maps and return period predictions for Bangladesh to those produced
					by the Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (from a physically-based model).
					In May 2023, we discussed applications for insurance and climate risk financing with collaborators
					in Bangladesh and ran a training on how to make a flood map
					in Google Earth Engine and with Machine Learning. Training materials from our 2 days course (code
					plus slides) are available <a
						href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCK5gs-8wCIV71N6z25KQvigbxowa5y2ieJemvT3_xU/edit">here.</a>
					We have developed a 500m weekly inundation data set for Bangladesh from 2001-2022 that fuses MODIS
					with Sentinel-1, see our <a href="https://beth-tellman.github.io/datasets.html">datasets</a> page

				<h3>Illicit activity and land change: Narcotrafficking in Central America</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/deforestation_Nica.jpg" alt="" /></span> Illicit economic
					activity shapes land use around the world, but inadequate data makes it difficult to quantify
					relationships. We've developed methods to leverage news media and satellite data to study how
					illicit activity shapes landscapes in Central America, the region where the vast majority of cocaine
					that arrives in the USA travels through. As the US war on drugs attempts to
					(unsuccessfully) intercept drug traffickers, they move into remote forested regions. This arrival of
					drugs, and the capital that comes with it, causes changes in land cover, use, ownership, and control
					with adverse
					impacts on Fieldwork, forests, and biodiveristy in Central America. In collaboration with a larger
					research team, we seek to better understand how narcotrafficking transforms landscapes and what
					policies could reduce violence and support sustainable development in the region.

				<h3>Informal urbanization: Mexico City</h3>

					and environmental consequences.</p>

				<h3> Infrastructure, water vulnerability, and adaptation: Rainwater Harvesting in Mexico City</h3>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/oxfam_study.png" alt="" /></span> As megacities grow,
					infrastructure choices may either reduce or further entrench vulnerability to water security. One
					decentralized adaptation to water stress is household rainwater harvesting, which can improve water
					access in the rainy season.
					We worked with Isla Urbana, an NGO in Mexico City, to estimate how their harvesting system could
					improve water security across the city if implemented on every home. Oxfam funded a study for us to
					build a large geospatial model
					to integrate satellite imagery, census data, climate data, and surveys to identify the neighborhoods
					where rainwater harvesting systems would reduce water stress and how many systems should be
					installed. The <a
						href="https://www.oxfammexico.org/sites/default/files/Captacion%20de%20agua%20en%20la%20CDMX.pdf">study</a>
					was
					the basis for the city government's plan to stall 100,000 systems where we indicate they could most
					improve water access.
