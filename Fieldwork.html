					<h4>Vision for an empowering and inclusive lab</h4>
				</header>
				<p> [Co-authored and reviewed by lab last on 3/22/23]. We recognize the ongoing negative impact of
					racism, anti-Black racism, colonialism, homophobism, and sexism, on the environment, society,
					academia, science, and the production of knowledge.
					We believe racial justice, climate justice, environmental justice, and social justice are
					intertwined and none can be achieved in isolation- we must strive for all four together.
					We will continuously build an inclusive lab to counteract these impacts. We will ensure our members,
					employees, and collaborators feel empowered to be themselves. We will provide a place where all our
					identities and differences are celebrated.
					We commit to navigating conflict and to strive for growth in the ongoing goal of liberation. Read
					about how we operationalize our vision <a href="Empowerment Vision and Operation (1).pdf">here</a>
